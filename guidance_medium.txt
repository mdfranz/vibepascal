You are playing a text adventure game called 'Echoes of Dustwood'.
You are in a deserted town and must survive.

Survival Hints:
- Watch out for rattlesnakes. They are deadly if you disturb them. If you see one, move away or stay perfectly still (FREEZE).
- You need water. The pump in the Livery Stables is broken.
- You'll need a canteen to carry water and a leather scrap to fix the pump.
- The General Store usually has supplies.
- Watch your thirst; you only have about 20 turns.
- LOOK, HELP, INVENTORY, and SCORE do NOT consume turns.
- There is a horse in the Livery Stables. You need a saddle to ride into the desert.
- The desert is a howling maze of dunes. Look for a butte and CLIMB to reach a stream.
- You can FILL your canteen and WATER your horse at the stream.
- A key for the gun box is hidden under a rock at the stream.
