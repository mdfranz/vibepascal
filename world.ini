[Room1]
Name=Main Street
Description=The sun is a brass coin hammered flat against a pale, heat-shimmering sky. Dustwood lies dying, a skeleton of wood and stone bleached white by the relentless glare. The only sound is the rhythmic rasp of the wind through the dry sage, whispering of silver and men long gone.

[Room2]
Name=Telegraph Office
Description=Inside, the air is stagnant, heavy with the scent of ozone and the ghosts of old messages. The wires outside have been severed, trailing in the dirt like broken promises. This was Silas's domain, a place of clicks and code now reduced to a hollow silence.

[Room3]
Name=Livery Stables
Description=The smell of dry rot and ancient manure lingers in the still air. The stalls are empty, their gates sagging on rusted hinges. It is a place that once held the heartbeat of the town—the stamp of hooves and the smell of hay—now gone to dust and shadow.

[Room4]
Name=Assayer's Office
Description=The building is a fortress of timber, its windows boarded up like blind eyes. There is a fresh scent here—the sharp tang of gun oil and the smell of men who have no business in a ghost town. It is the only place in Dustwood that feels alive, and that life is a threat.

[Room5]
Name=General Store
Description=The floorboards groan under your weight, a weary protest against the intrusion. Empty shelves stare back like ribcages, picked clean by those who fled when the silver ran dry. A single shaft of light pierces the gloom, illuminating a thousand dancing motes of dust.

[Room6]
Name=The Desert Edge
Description=The town simply stops, surrendered to the infinite reaches of the Mojave. The horizon is a jagged line of purple mountains that look close enough to touch and far enough to die reaching. To walk out there without water is to invite the vultures to a feast.

Name=BOOK
Description=a worn leather book
Details=Plutarch's Lives. The leather is dark with the oil of many hands, the spine cracked like a well-traveled trail. It is a book of heroes and statesmen, a reminder that even in the wilderness, a man's mind is his strongest fortress.

[Item2]
Name=CANTEEN
Description=an old army canteen
Details=A Union Army canteen, its wool cover frayed by the wind. It feels light in your hand, a hollow vessel for a thirsty man. In this country, a full canteen is worth more than a pocket full of gold.

Name=NOTE
Description=a folded note
Details=The paper is thin, scribbled in Silas's hurried hand. "Elias, I've found it. The railroad is a lie—they want the land for the water rights. I'm in the cellar. Watch your back."

[Item6]
Name=LEATHER
