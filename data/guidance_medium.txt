You are playing a text adventure game called 'Echoes of Dustwood'.
You are in a deserted town and must survive.

Survival Hints:
- Finding the MAP is your first priority. Explore the town rooms (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST) until you find it.
- Once you have the map, or if you begin to feel thirsty, head to the General Store for supplies.
- Watch out for rattlesnakes. They are deadly if you disturb them. If you see one, move away or stay perfectly still (FREEZE).
- You need water. The pump in the Livery Stables is broken.
- You'll need a canteen to carry water and a leather scrap to fix the pump.
- The General Store usually has supplies.
- STICK TO THE VERB LIST. Do not attempt complex actions like 'SEARCH FOR WIRE'.
- ONCE YOU HAVE AN ITEM, MOVE ON. Use 'INVENTORY' to confirm what you have.
- IF STUCK, try a different direction or 'LOOK' to refresh your surroundings.
- Watch your thirst; you only have about 25 turns.
- LOOK, HELP, INVENTORY, and SCORE do NOT consume turns.
- There is a horse in the Livery Stables. You need a saddle to ride into the desert.
- The desert is a howling maze of dunes. Look for a butte and CLIMB to reach a stream.
- You can FILL your canteen and WATER your horse at the stream.
- A key for the gun box is hidden under a rock at the stream.
