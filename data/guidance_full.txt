You are playing a text adventure game called 'Echoes of Dustwood'.
- CRITICAL: STICK TO THE VERB LIST. Use only simple commands like 'TAKE WIRE' or 'FIX PUMP'.
- ONCE YOU HAVE AN ITEM, MOVE ON to the next task.
- Use 'INVENTORY' to confirm you have the required items.
- IF STUCK, 'LOOK' or move to a different room.
- LOOK, HELP, INVENTORY, SCORE, EXAMINE, SEARCH, and CHECK INVENTORY do NOT consume turns.
Do NOT use LOOK if the room description and items are already visible in the previous output. 
Move efficiently: if you know the exits and have checked for items, move to the next room or perform your task immediately.
Only use INVENTORY when you need to confirm you have a required item.
You will die after 25 turns without water. Your horse will die after too long in the desert without water.
When you enter a new room for the first time, use LOOK to see the exits so you can plan your movement.
If you already took an item, do NOT try to TAKE it again. Move on.
Never TAKE an item you already have in your inventory.
Avoid using INVENTORY right after taking something unless you need to confirm a requirement.
Only TAKE items that are visibly listed in the room's item list.
Take the MAP as soon as you find it; it reveals exits in rooms.

Map Directions:
- EAST: General Store (Go here for canteen and leather)
- WEST: Sheriff's Office (Go here for the gun box)
- WEST from Sheriff's Office: Assayer's Office
- SOUTH: Livery Stables (Go here for the PUMP)
- NORTH: Telegraph Office
- The MAP is hidden in a random town room (Rooms 1-7).
- SOUTH from the Desert Edge leads into the desert (only safe with a saddled horse).

Task Sequence:
1. PRIMARY GOAL: Explore the town rooms (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST) until you find the MAP, then TAKE MAP. 
   - This is your top priority. Do not stop searching for the map unless you start to get thirsty.
   - If you have explored a room and it doesn't have the MAP, do not keep LOOKing there; move to a different room.
1b. While searching for the map: If you are in the Telegraph Office, TAKE WIRE and FIX TELEGRAPH using the wire (optional but scores).
2. ONLY IF YOU ARE THIRSTY or have the MAP: Move to the General Store (EAST from Main Street).
3. TAKE items one at a time: TAKE CANTEEN, TAKE LEATHER, TAKE SADDLE, TAKE MATCHES.
3. Do NOT waste turns in the store. Move WEST to return to Main Street once you have the items.
4. Move WEST to the Sheriff's Office.
5. The box is locked. You need a key from the stream (hidden under a rock). Check the Assayer's Office for a clue if needed.
6. Move EAST to return to Main Street, then SOUTH to the Livery Stables.
7. FIX PUMP (requires Leather).
8. FILL canteen at the pump (requires Canteen).
9. DRINK (resets thirst).
10. SADDLE HORSE (requires Saddle).
11. Move SOUTH to Desert Edge, then SOUTH into the desert (Dry Wash).
12. Navigate the Howling Desert to reach the Butte.
13. CLIMB at the Butte to reach the stream.
14. At the stream, EXAMINE ROCK to reveal the KEY, then TAKE KEY.
15. FILL at the stream and WATER horse at the stream.
16. Return to Sheriff's Office, OPEN BOX, TAKE REVOLVER.
17. If you are safe and supplied, you can keep exploring; avoid wasting turns.

Threats:
- RATTLESNAKE: If you see a snake, DO NOT 'TAKE' or 'FIX' anything. Either move or 'FREEZE'.
- DIRTY OUTLAW: If you see an outlaw, DO NOT 'TAKE' or 'FIX' anything. Use 'SHOOT OUTLAW' (requires Revolver) or move to another room. Do NOT 'FREEZE' with an outlaw present.
- If both snake and outlaw are present, immediately move to another room (N/S/E/W) rather than freezing.

Horse:
- You can find a HORSE in the Livery Stables (SOUTH).
- Use 'MOUNT' to ride and 'DISMOUNT' to get off.
- You cannot enter buildings (NORTH, WEST, or EAST from Main Street) while riding.

Command Notes:
- There is no TAKE ALL. Use TAKE <ITEM> for each item.
- Use EXAMINE <ITEM> (not INSPECT) if you want details.
